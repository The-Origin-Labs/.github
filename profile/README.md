# Welcome to The Origin Labs



Welcome to The Origin Labs. We are part of a mission to address the lack of secure property rights in India, particularly for the urban poor. Our goal is to promote greater security and stability in property ownership by facilitating discussions between individuals and government officials, updating land records, and offering resources for obtaining legal assistance.

## Problem Statement

|  | |
| -------- | -------- |
| The lack of secure property rights in India is a significant problem, particularly for the urban poor. Disputes over land ownership slow down real estate transactions, and those without official documents face barriers to accessing financial and government services. Our Application is created to facilitate discussions between individuals and government officials to update land records and establish ownership. We provide education on property rights and offer resources for obtaining legal assistance. By addressing these issues, the project would help promote greater security and stability in property ownership in India.   |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ![cff4948aaa0badc5669ce15f40d99da2e6783ffc (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43869046/213860427-920c4a83-7fa9-41fb-a0eb-84758b480c9d.png) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; |


## Project Repositories

To achieve our mission, we have divided our project into several microservices, each playing a vital role in our overall solution.

### 1. Landate - Golang Microservices

Repository: [The-Origin-Labs/landate](https://github.com/The-Origin-Labs/landate)

Landate is the backbone of our project, written in Golang, and follows a microservices-based architecture. This repository houses the core functionalities of our application, enabling discussions, updating land records, and verifying ownership between individuals and government officials.

### 2. Polychain - Blockchain Microservices

Repository: [The-Origin-Labs/polychain](https://github.com/The-Origin-Labs/polychain)

Polychain is an essential component of our project, employing Solidity and NodeJs to harness the power of blockchain technology. Through Polychain, we aim to provide an immutable and transparent ledger, further ensuring secure property rights and minimizing disputes.

### 3. Hope.ai - OCR Microservice

Repository: [The-Origin-Labs/hope.ai](https://github.com/The-Origin-Labs/hope.ai)

Hope.ai is our OCR (Optical Character Recognition) microservice, built using Node.js. This service plays a crucial role in digitizing and managing land documents, making them easily accessible and searchable.

### 4. Frontend - React Application

Our frontend, developed using React, provides a user-friendly interface for individuals and government officials to interact seamlessly, fostering a collaborative effort to establish and verify property ownership.
